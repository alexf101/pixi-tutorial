            <h1>Welcome to Giraffe!</h1>
            <p>The Giraffe's will mitosis if they eat three apples</p>
            <p>When they mitosis, they disappear and two new giraffe's appear in their place. The new giraffe's have a randomly generated neck length in the vicinity of their parent.</p>
            <p>When Giraffe's do not eat for awhile, they turn red. A short while later, they will disappear.</p>
            <p>You can adjust the height of each tree by clicking and dragging it by its canopy.</p>
            <p>You win if you can coax a giraffe to eat an apple for the Great Tree, the large tree in the middle. You lose if all the giraffe's die.</p>
            <p>In this way, we see the processes of evolution - natural selection and random variation - at work.</p>
